### Understanding of the RS485
It's a communication protocol, very popular in all the areas of automation. Because it prevents interferences, has long-distance communication, has high speed, can connect multiple devices, etc. 
This protocol, in plenty of occasions, works with a different protocol; this is Modbus. Modbus has access to an upper level that allows structuring the data.  


### Applications
I will use an urcap that has this protocol that whits for data. Ojo: in a simulator dosen't work.
